      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        So, you're new to programming and maybe heard from a friend or a youtube
        video about something called Github. Well, let me tell ya, it's pretty
        neat (& neat definitely an understatement!)
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick overview: Github is a web-based version control system for
        tracking changes in files and coordinating work on projects. It's a
        great way to share code and collaborate on projects.

        GitHub has become one of the few necessary platforms to use in today's
        web development world. It is a great tool that makes your life easier,
        has the potential to make you stand out from other web developers and
        hosts some of the biggest and most interesting projects out there
        today.Midjourney is one of a few AI image generators, alongside DALL-E
        and Google’s Imagen, which are currently in various stages of heavily
        publicized beta testing. These AI are fed a prompt, and then generate a
        series of images based upon the prompt and a machine learning algorithm
        modeled on other pieces of art.
