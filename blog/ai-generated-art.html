      <p>
        Dynamically creating art based on a simple sentance seems like it could
        be too good to be true, but recently I've been experimenting with
        <a href="midjourney.com" style="text-decoration: underline"
          >midjourney.com</a
        >, and that reality is today!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always struggled to find images online that work nicely with my
        projects, are aesthetically pleasing, and not filled with watermarks (or
        free to use). Luckily, I've found a new way to create art that works in
        seconds and is totally free (at least for the first 30 images). Try it
        out!

        Midjourney is one of a few AI image generators, alongside DALL-E and
        Google’s Imagen, which are currently in various stages of heavily
        publicized beta testing. These AI are fed a prompt, and then generate a
        series of images based upon the prompt and a machine learning algorithm
        modeled on other pieces of art. - Vice.com
