      <h2>Lets go!</h2>
      <p>
        When starting a new project, especially when working in a team, there
        are many things that need to go just right to avoid the dreaded “drama”.
        You know the type -- the constant change in design, scope, and
        requirements; not knowing what pieces to start first or work on next --
        that "drama".
      </p>
      <p>
        Say hello to a development method called "agile". It's a method that
        includes 5 stages to better manage the project and working with team
        members.
      </p>
      <p>Without getting into the details too much, here are the 5 stages:</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        <b class="bold">1) Planning</b> - Define the purpose & goal <br />
        <b class="bold">2) Development</b> - First stage of building <br />
        <b class="bold">3) Testing</b> - Addressing bugs & errors <br />
        <b class="bold">4) Deployment</b> - Ready for release <br />
        <b class="bold">5) Operations</b> - Continuous maintainance<br />
      </p>

      >
        Agile processes defer decisions, shorten development cycles, and support
        just in time analysis of requests. This allows agile teams to change
        quickly and at a low cost. That provides a competitive advantage and is
        one of the keys to agile ways of working.<br />
