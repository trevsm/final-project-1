      <h2>Where to begin?</h2>
      <p>
        As I'm sure many new aspiring programmers know, the learning curve can
        be steap! Tutorials to the rescue, right? Unfortunately, after following
        along countless number of tutorials many find themselves stuck in what
        they might call “Tutorial Purgatory” -- feeling like they aren't
        progressing no matter how much time they spend trying to learn from
        tutorials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here's a trick I've learned from my own time in this situation:
        <br />
        Instead of following along with tutorials, try to think up your OWN
        project and start working on it. That's it. The best way to learn is by
        doing. As you work on the project, you will be forced to troubleshoot
        your own very specific bugs and start to pick up new skills quicker!

        Distill your vision so that you're not overwhelmed with having to learn
        everything. You're heading in the right direction if you're producing
        results and feeling confident. <br />
